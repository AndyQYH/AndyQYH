### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ–¥ I am an entry-level software developer specializing in full-stack development and recommendation system analysis. 
ğŸ—’ I recently worked on many projects that dealt with extracting data from social media and sanitizing their meanings with the OpenAI API. 
ğŸ–Œ I am also active in developing and maintaining websites made by start-ups, along with testing. 
ğŸ‘¯ I am open to any new challenges and would like to join a team that also shares a similar passion.
